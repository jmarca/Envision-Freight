      <h1>Freight Land Use Conflicts</h1>
        <p>Any time that competing (and often, incompatible) land uses exist in proximity to one another there is the likelihood of these uses somehow interfering with each other.  This concept is closely tied to the economic concept of externality, where one individualâ€™s actions inflict costs (either monetary costs, physical costs, or emotional costs) on others.</p>
        <p>Among the <a href="pdf/Conflicts_and_Barriers.pdf">major conflicts with non-freight interests</a> (e.g., residential or commercial developments) have with freight operations are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Air pollution</li>
        <li>Light pollution</li>
        <li>Noise pollution</li>
        <li>Effects of vibration</li>
        <li>Safety issues</li>
        <li>Congestion</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Some conflicts, such as noise, light, and vibration are common to all of the primary freight modes.  Other conflicts are more specific to particular modes.  For example, the potential for dangerous trespass tends to be specific to railroads.</p>  
        <p>From the perspective of freight interests, <a href="pdf/Conflicts_and_Barriers.pdf">barriers to the efficient operation of freight activities</a> in many ways are the corollary of conflicting land uses.  Examples of barriers include:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Speed restrictions</li>
        <li>Limitations on hours of operation</li>  
        <li>Height and clearance impacts</li> 
        <li>Size and weight limitations</li> 
        <li>Corridor design impacts</li> 
        <li>Difficulty of dredging operations and disposal of dredged material</li>  
        </ul>

        <p>Some of these barriers can be mode-specific (e.g., highway and road design impacts 
        on trucking activities or dredging impacts on waterway transportation), while other 
        barriers may be more general across modes (e.g., limitations on hours of operation).  
        Barriers not only affect freight activities along particular corridors and facilities, 
        but they may also affect route choices and the ability to access freight and 
        manufacturing facilities.  For example, if particular roads are designed with turning 
        radii that are too tight, particular types of trucks may not be able to use these 
        routes or access facilities that use these roads.</p>
        
        <p>Resolution of conflicting land uses and minimization of barriers to the efficient
        provision of freight transportation yield significant benefits to both producers and
        consumers. The sources of encroachment of freight facilities are corridors have been 
        summarized in a series of <a href="pdf/Conflicts_and_Barriers_Matrix.pdf">
        Conflicts and Barriers Matrices</a>. The research conducted for NCRRP 24 also produced
        a series of case studies to illustrate many of these issues.
        <a href="pdf/Intro_and_Lessons_Learned.pdf">Issues were identified
        during the review of these case studies</a>:</p>

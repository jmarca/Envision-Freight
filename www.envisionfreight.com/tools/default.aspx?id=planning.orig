      <p>The most successful corridor protection strategies rely on early, consistent, and clear planning.  Planning is the first and most important step in creating effective processes and opportunities to lead to Freight Oriented Development, reduce community-freight conflicts, and preserve critical freight corridors and facilities.</p>   
<p>Tools that are necessary to achieve effective advanced planning include:</p> 
<ul>
  <li><a href="/tools/pdf/State_Enabling_Act_Overview.pdf">State enabling acts</a> (that authorize the development of comprehensive plans by the local jurisdictions) should require freight planning (<a href="/tools/pdf/State_Enabling_Act_Examples.pdf">Examples</a>)</li>

<p>Most issues about future land uses affecting the present or future viability of freight facilities arise from, or come to a head, in the context of zoning or development site plan approvals.  Almost always, nothing is built in America unless and until the use of the land concerned has been approved in a city or county general plan, the property has been specifically zoned for that use, a development site plan has been approved, and a building permit issued.  These are all local government functions.</p> 
<p>One way is to protect from zoning and site plan decisions being poorly made is to decide the issues in advance in the regular updates of the city or county’s general or comprehensive plan.  The city or county’s comprehensive plan (also called a general plan in some places) is intended, and in most places required, to guide these zoning and site plan decisions.  The comprehensive plan also sets expectations as to the allowed use of land in various locations, and developers and builders may make investment decisions based on that plan.</p>
<p>Comprehensive plan updates almost always are performed following a menu of topics provided in the state’s planning enabling act.  If these laws required or suggested that plans to protect all modes of freight issues should be included in a general plan, significant new protections would likely evolve naturally in our land use system nationwide in the next decade or so.</p>
<p>Local land use planning decisions are also informed and influenced by regional visions. Strategic visioning is an emerging approach to problem solving being applied by major metropolitan regions across the country.  Strategic visioning recognizes that today’s urban challenges have natural boundaries (e.g., air sheds, watersheds, and commuter sheds) that must be respected in seeking best solutions.  Most regional visions do not currently deal with freight in depth, but tremendous potential exists to significantly affect decision making that impacts freight.  The regional vision is the right scale at which to tackle freight issues. An important component in making informed land use decisions as they relate to freight transportation is an understanding of the economic costs and benefits of these decisions.  In the context of freight transportation corridors, economic costs and benefits must be viewed on a large-scale perspective as freight transportation infrastructure is an important factor in the performance of the U.S. economy and a region’s competiveness on a global scale.</p>

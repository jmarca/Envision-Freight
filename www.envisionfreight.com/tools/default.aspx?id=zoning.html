      <div class="sidebar"><p>There are three primary impediments to adequate freight zoning and design:</p>
<ol>
<li>Historical activities/decisions and the lack of freight sector input</li>
<li>Planners have not always been taught about freight</li>
<li>Planning for freight corridors and facilities was not required by state Department’s of Transportation to attain federal funding until 1991.</li>
</ol>   
</p>
</div>

<p>The development and sophistication of strategies to plan, zone and create design standards for development around corridors to prevent encroachment of incompatible uses, or to mitigate for effects, has varied greatly from state to state.   Very few zoning codes specifically refer to freight or freight modes.  Freight is usually encapsulated within the Industrial zoning code.  Zoning overlays are beginning to be used to preserve industrial areas that are served by the freight industry. Examples zoning overlays include Baltimore’s Maritime Industrial Overlay District, and Portland’s Guild’s Lake Industrial Sanctuary.</p>

<p>A number of factors have contributed to deficiencies in zoning, lot design and the development of land uses that should be considered ‘sensitive’ when they are placed in proximity to freight corridors and facilities.  These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The historical lack of interaction between the freight industry and local and state planning entities</li>
<li>The lack of education about freight facilities, their needs and potential impacts from their activities</li>  
<li>The role of developers in projects that do not take into account freight activities</li>
</ul>

<p>For many years, the freight industry was not involved in land use planning decision meetings and did not regularly interact with local and state planning organizations.  On the other hand, many planners have not had adequate training on freight issues in their formal education.  By not properly considering freight issues, the developer community could also be considered the third leg of the stool contributing to the problem of incompatible land uses in proximity to freight corridors and facilities.</p>

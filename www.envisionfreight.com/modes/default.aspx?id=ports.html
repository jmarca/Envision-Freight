      <h1>Deepwater Ports</h1>
      
      <p>The current location and layout of ports around the United States came about due to a combination of geographic, historical and political factors.  The oldest ports in the United States developed around natural harbors–coastal areas that have a rare combination of attributes that made them well-suited for receiving and protecting maritime vessels.  Many of the country’s greatest and most historic cities including New York, Boston and San Francisco are anchored by natural harbors despite the fact that, in all three of these cases, much of the land once used for maritime trade has been crowded out by other competing land uses.</p> 
<p>Artificial harbors have been engineered to emulate the navigation attributes of natural harbors with breakwaters serving the role of surrounding land.  As a general rule, artificial harbors have been built to serve preexisting demand from a surrounding population center.  Regardless of their origin, all U.S. ports represent an accumulation of investments, usually over the course of decades.  Because of strategic location and fixed capital investment, the preservation of port assets is important for the functioning of the freight transportation system and the performance of the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>The importance of marine ports to the U.S. economy has grown in relation to international trade.  This growth has produced remarkable changes to U.S. society considering that, until 30 years ago, for example, the United States was barred from engaging in any maritime trade with China.  Today, China constitutes the United States’ largest maritime trading partner.  <a href="http://www.marad.dot.gov/library_landing_page/data_and_statistics/Data_and_Statistics.htm">In total, maritime imports and exports, almost all of which moved through deepwater ports, constituted 1.2 trillion metric tons in 2009.</a></p>   
 
<h2>Impediments to Efficient Port Operation</h2>
<p>Maintaining the system of ports and channels to process this large volume of trade requires massive amounts of dredging.  <a href="http://www.ndc.iwr.usace.army.mil/dredge/dredge.htm">In 2009, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) moved 145 million cubic yards of dredge material from U.S. deepwater ports, the inland waterway system, and the Great Lakes at a cost of over one billion dollars.</a>   This figure does not include other dredging efforts undertaken by private parties outside of the USACE-maintained system of channels.</p>  
<p>Another key impediment faced by ports around the country, particularly those in large cities, is the competition for the waterfront by other types of land use including housing, parks, and retail.  The slow conversion of maritime properties to non-industrial use can subtly weaken the viability of a port to the point where it no longer has the ability to take on new types of business and can no longer perform essential functions without causing significant disruptions to neighboring residents.  If this happens, a port will generally lose its industrial customers and become a vestigial industrial waterfront with uses that create fewer impacts but also fewer jobs.</p>  
<p>There are numerous examples of attempted ""port gentrification"" efforts, including the recent Providence 2020 plan, which is a plan to redevelop the waterfront with a less industrial orientation.  The long-term implications of converting port land to non-industrial use should be carefully considered given that, as stated by the Massachusetts Seaport Advisory Council, "Port property that is lost to gentrification is lost forever."<a href="default.aspx%3Fid=ports.html#fn1">[1]</a></p> 

<h2>Conflicts Created By Port Activity</h2>
<p>Like all industrial activities, port activity produces a number of potential conflicts with surrounding land uses.  The nature of the conflict is closely tied to the type of cargo handled as well as the volume of total cargoes.</p> 
<p>Containers are one of the most rapidly growing cargo types within the U.S. freight system.  One of the key features of container traffic is the need for trucks to take the containers, one by one, to and from the port terminals.  This trucking impact is often a key point of contention between ports and surrounding communities, because the trucks do not stay confined within the port area.  One of the key mitigation strategies used by ports in recent years to reduce conflict with surrounding communities has been to segregate truck traffic, either by placing incentives for truckers to make off-peak deliveries or championing the construction of bypass routes that would allow trucks to avoid routes used by motorists.  Cutting emissions from trucks is another area that ports have supported through banning the oldest trucks from calling a port or providing incentives to purchase newer vehicles.  Container ports also require substantial distribution capacity outside of the port itself.  These distribution centers widen and broaden a port’s area of impact.</p>   
<p>Container ports also produce noise in the loading and unloading process as container operations involve stacking containers weighing up to 65,000 pounds.  One strategy employed by ports to mitigate this problem has been the acquisition of <a href="http://www.jwdliftech.com/Publications/Cranes/Procurement%20and%20New%20Development/Reducing%20the%20Environmental%20Impact%20of%20Quayside%20Cranes%20on%20Neighboring%20Communities%20Paper.pdf">newer cranes that can produce an approximate 10 dB reduction through the use of features such as sound absorbing panels</a>,  and by means of computerized controls can place containers on top of each other with greater precision.</p> 
<p>Some types of cargo are moved out by rail, in which case, the impacts associated with rail shipments can cause unwanted noise that is more noticeable at night.  Rail-based loading operations that work on a 24-hour schedule would include military deployments that have become a consistent feature at ports designated to receive such cargo.</p> 
<p>Bulk cargo, such as coal or wood chips, can produce dust and suspended particles while being loaded or unloaded.  Particulates can also be generated by the movement of heavy equipment, such as trucks, over unpaved areas of a port.</p>
<p>Unloading operations that require illumination can produce light pollution.  Unwanted illumination can also be an issue during the construction of new port assets, a process that can take years.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Buffering</h2>
<p>Port operations have, if anything, become less intrusive as technology and practices improve.  Nevertheless, ports need sufficient space to operate and also require land for buffer zones to allow noise and other impacts to dissipate.  Ports also require land for future development to respond to unforeseen changes in the economy.  However, land that is in proximity to ports is often highly attractive for residential development as it is, by definition, near the sea.  The reasons deepwater ports can handle massive amounts of cargo within a comparatively small, concentrated area is that they utilize three-dimensional space with the cargo-laden holds of ships sinking over 40 feet beneath the surface of the water and stacks of containers that reach almost as high into the air.  Restricting the ability of deepwater ports to serve this function efficiently will likely mean that more ports need to be constructed.  For example, to replace the cargo handling capability of the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the U.S. would need to construct approximately 15-medium sized container ports along the West Coast, each of which would require its own dredged access channel.</p>

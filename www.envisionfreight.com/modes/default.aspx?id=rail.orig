      <h2>Role and Importance of the Railroad Industry in the U.S. Economy</h2>

<p>Railroads are an important part of the U.S. economy.  Since 1980, railroads have captured an increasing share of U.S. freight shipments.  According to data complied by the U.S. Department of Transportation, railroads accounted for about 27 percent of the ton-miles of U.S. freight moved in 1980.  The latest data show that in 2007, the share of ton-miles attributed to railroads increased to almost 40 percent.  For comparison purposes, trucks accounted for the next largest share, accounting for about 18 percent of the ton-miles of U.S. freight shipments in 1980 and almost 29 percent in 2007.</p>  
<p>The low-value, bulk nature, and the relatively long distances of the commodities transported by rail are evident when ton-miles are contrasted with value of shipments.  In 2007, rail shipments accounted for only 4 percent of the value of U.S. freight shipments while trucks accounted for over 70 percent of the value of 2007 freight shipments.</p>
<p>In terms of both tons originated and revenues generated, coal is the most important commodity hauled by rail.  According to figures compiled by the Association of American Railroads (AAR), coal accounted for 47 percent of tons originated by railroads in 2009 and 25 percent of railroads’ 2009 gross revenues.  The next largest commodity group was chemicals and allied products, which in 2009 accounted for almost 10 percent of railroad's tons originated and 14 percent of railroads' gross revenues.  Reflecting the lingering effects of the recent recession and the U.S. economy’s slow recovery, miscellaneous mixed shipments (which is largely intermodal traffic consisting of containers and trailers on flatcars) fell to only 13 percent of railroads’ gross revenues in 2009.  Typically, intermodal shipments are the next largest category of railroads’ revenues behind coal.</p>
<p>While railroads play a key role in overall U.S. freight shipments, some commodities are particularly dependent on rail transportation.  For example, the AAR reports that 70 percent of domestically produced automobiles, 70 percent of coal delivered to power plants, and about 35 percent of the U.S. grain harvest move by rail.</p>

<h2>Structure of the U.S. Freight Railroad Industry</h2>
<p>The recent history of the U.S. freight railroad industry has been marked by landmark regulatory reform, industry consolidation, and significantly improved performance.  By 1973, several large railroads in the Northeastern U.S. faced bankruptcy. Concerns about this issue led to the passage of the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 (the 3-R Act).  The 3-R Act resulted in reorganizing the Northeastern railroads under federal control, the formation of Conrail, and the abandonment of about 3,000 miles of track.  Continued financial problems for railroads outside the Northeast U.S. resulted in the passage of the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976 (the 4-R Act).  The 4-R Act allowed railroads more latitude regarding the setting of rates.  In particular, it set the stage for the deregulation of rates by allowing railroads freedom to set rates for traffic where there was competition.</p> 
<p>The next major event in the deregulation of the railroad industry was the passage of the landmark Staggers Rail Act in 1980.  The Staggers Act provided railroads with a high level of freedom in setting rates, gave them the right to negotiate private rate contracts with shippers, and decreased the difficulty of abandoning unprofitable rail lines.  Among the effects of the Staggers Act, railroad industry productivity has generally matched or surpassed that of the overall economy, rates to shippers are lower than prior to Staggers, and the industry has become financially stable.</p>
<p>Consolidations in the railroad industry have reduced the number of Class I railroads (the largest railroads) from about forty around the time of the passage of the Staggers Act to the current seven, and the number of Class I employees declined from over 450,000 in 1980 to 152,000 in 2009.  The seven Class I railroads are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burlington Northern Santa Fe</li>
<li>Canadian National</li>
<li>Canadian Pacific</li>
<li>CSX</li>
<li>Kansas City Southern</li>
<li>Norfolk Southern</li>
<li>Union Pacific</li>
</ul>

<p>While the number of Class I railroads has declined, the total number of U.S. railroads has increased from about 490 in the mid-1980s to 563 in 2009.</p>
<p>In 2009, 139,000 miles of road were operated by U.S. railroads (excluding trackage rights), of which 94,000 were operated by the seven Class I railroads.  Reflecting the abandonment of unprofitable lines since the passage of the Staggers Act, the percentage of total miles operated by Class I’s has fallen from about 80 percent in the mid-1980s to about 70 percent today.  This reduction not only reflects abandonments by the Class I’s but also the use of many of the abandoned lines by smaller railroads.  Figure 1 shows routes of the U.S. freight railroads.</p>

<h2>Common Railroad Encroachment Issues</h2>
<p>Table 1 lists common encroachment issues faced by freight rail transportation.  One obvious source of conflict between railroad activity and other uses occurs at grade crossings, where long, slow trains impede the flow of vehicle traffic (including emergency vehicles).  Less obvious conflicts include the noise and vibration caused by freight trains that are not only nuisances but, particularly in the case of vibration, can also cause physical damage.</p>

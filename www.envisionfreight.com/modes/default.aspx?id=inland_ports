      <h1>Inland Ports</h1>
      
      <p>Inland ports represent a relatively new concept within the US freight system and have the capability to substantially reduce the severity of conflicts between freight and other land uses.  The following formal definition has appeared in the literature:</p>
<p class="quote"><a href="http://www.utexas.edu/research/ctr/pdf_reports/4083_2.pdf">An inland port is a site located away from traditional land, air and coastal borders with the vision to facilitate and process international trade through strategic investment in multi-modal transportation assets and by promoting value added services as goods move through the supply chain.</a></p>

<p>These facilities emerged partially as the result of the consolidation of major intermodal corridors following deregulation of the rail industry.  Another key driver of the creation of inland ports was the closure of military facilities in the 1990s, which opened up large new industrial sites that had the base infrastructure for a distribution hub.  As the complexity of supply chains has grown, inland ports have played an important role in making the system of cargo delivery more flexible.  Furthermore, inland ports have led to creation of international trade jobs in areas of the country that were previously assumed to be ill-suited to participate in the international trade economy.</p> 
<h2>Inland Port Impacts</h2>
<p>Given that most inland ports were designed and implemented in the last two decades, they do not have many of the ‘legacy’ features, such as a lack of buffering between land uses, found at historic rail yard and port facilities.  Nevertheless, inland ports can also create conflicts due to factors such as truck congestion.</p> 
<p>The truck traffic that is produced by an inland port will vary depending on the distance of the facility from its feeder ports and its integration with the local economy.  For example, an inland port that is located away from any major population center is likely to be self-contained with cargo entering the port facility, being reprocessed, and leaving by rail or by truck.  Alternatively, some inland ports are located in large urban areas to take advantage of preexisting networks of suppliers and customers.  These facilities, such as <a href="http://www.alliancetexas.com/">Alliance, Texas</a> in the Dallas/Fort Worth metro area, coordinate their activities with other distribution centers within the city and, therefore, serve as a magnet for truck deliveries emanating from the urban area.</p> 
<p>The <a href="http://www.portofvirginia.com/facilities/virginia-inland-port.aspx">Virginia Inland Port</a> (Figure 1) was one of the first inland ports to be designed specifically to remove pressure from a marine port—in this case, the Port of Virginia’s Hampton Roads terminal.</a>

<p style="source">Source: <a href="http://www.ctb.virginia.gov/resources/kr_1_VAInlandPort_Fall07.pdf">http://www.ctb.virginia.gov/resources/kr_1_VAInlandPort_Fall07.pdf</a> 

<p>The extra-urban setting of the Virginia Inland Port has allowed the noise and congestion associated with port traffic to be moved to a setting where there are minimal potential conflicts with other land uses.  If an inland port is placed in a previously non-industrial area, however, there is always the potential for community resistance.  Therefore, the advantages of removing port operations from areas that have historically performed such functions in order to make way for different types of land use must be balanced against the possibility of creating a new set of conflicts in a new location.</p>
<p>Inland ports have been a critical component in the development of the Heartland Corridor project, which connects Norfolk, Virginia to Chicago.  This rail corridor that opened to double stack service in the fall of 2010.  The corridor required the development of inland terminals for the Norfolk Southern, such as the Rickenbacker terminal in Ohio.   The Heartland Corridor helped to demonstrate that the inland port concept is no longer seen as a retrofit strategy for overburdened corridors, but can be an integral part of the corridor planning process from the start.</p>
<p>Given the subtle distinctions separating inland ports from related concepts such as freight villages, or integrated logistics centers, there is no comprehensive accounting of inland ports across the country.  The term is sometimes applied retroactively to facilities that were not originally referred to as inland ports once they have reached a critical mass.  The intermodal facility at Joliet and Elwood, Illinois is such a case.  Joliet/Elwood has been increasingly referred to as an inland port as more distribution and a second rail terminal have clustered within the area.  Terminology aside, inland ports are simply an agglomeration of freight activity involving multiple modes. Thus, the methodology for analyzing the potential impact of an inland port on surrounding land use is to study the specific attributes of each mode serving the facility and then to combine this information with the economic and demographic nature of the region in which the facility is located.</p>

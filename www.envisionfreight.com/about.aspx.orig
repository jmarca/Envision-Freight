      <h1>About EnvisionFreight</h1>
      <p>This website was developed as part of the <a href="http://www.trb.org/NCFRP/Public/NCFRP.aspx">National Cooperative Freight Research Program (NCFRP)</a> project, <a href="http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/archive/NotesDocs/NCFRP_Announcement.pdf"><i>Preserving and Protecting Freight Infrastructure and Routes</i></a>, funded by the <a href="http://www.trb.org/Main/Home.aspx">Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Academies</a>.  The project began in November 2009.  The <a href="http://144.171.11.40/cmsfeed/TRBNetProjectDisplay.asp?ProjectID=2667">project announcement</a> can be found on the TRB's website.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this project is to provide practical tools to predict potential conflicts between land use for freight transportation purposes and alternative uses, and to provide guidance for intelligent solutions and policies to minimize and resolve such conflicts.  The target audience for this study consists of decision makers involved in freight facility, transportation, and land use decisions.  This includes state departments of commerce and transportation, metropolitan planning organizations, local officials and their planning offices, legislators and their staffs, freight facility developers, and real estate concerns.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.lrca.com/">Christensen Associates</a> was the lead on the project, along with the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/research/ctr/">University of Texas Center for Transportation Research</a> and Grow & Bruening, P.C.  The project team also benefitted from the input of Kathryn Pett, formerly of Nossaman, LLP.</p>

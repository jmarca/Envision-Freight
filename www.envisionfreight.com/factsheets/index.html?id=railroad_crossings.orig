      <h1><a href="/factsheets/default.aspx">Fact Sheets</a>: Railroad Grade Crossings</h1>
      
      <p>A railroad grade crossing is an intersection where a roadway crosses railroad tracks at the same level (grade).  These are found all over the U.S.  According to the <a href="http://www.fra.dot.gov/Pages/86.shtml>Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)</a> there are more than 250,000 grade crossings in the U.S.</p>   

<p>The responsibility for grade crossing safety is shared between the <a href="http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/about/outreach/railcrossing/railcrossing-agencies.htm">Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA)</a>, FRA, and the <a href="http://safety.fhwa.dot.gov/xings/">Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)</a>.  State DOTs, local jurisdictions and railroads are also involved in grade crossing safety issues.</p>   

<p>Railroad companies own and maintain the tracks, and own the property on either side of the tracks.  At the grade-crossings they install and maintain the tracks and the roadway surface around and between the rails, as well as any traffic control devices on their right of way.</p> 

<p>According to the FRA, although the railroad owns the track, the roadway at a crossing is owned by either a public or private entity. Public crossings are those at which the highway or roadway is under the jurisdiction of and maintained by a public authority such as a municipality, county, or state agency. Private crossings are those where the roadway is privately owned (such as on a farm or within an industrial complex), is not intended for public use, and is not maintained by a public authority. The roadway owner, public or private, typically maintains the road approaching the crossing on either side of tracks.</p>  

<p>The FHWA is responsible for public grade crossing issues that affect highway safety.  The FHWA develops and provides guidelines and standards for the correct design of grade crossings, the assessment of safety at the crossings, and the placement of traffic control devices at approaches to the grade crossing.</p>

<p>Federal law requires that every time a train approaches an at-grade crossing it must sound its horn.   Obviously this is for safety reasons, and to provide a signal to anyone on the grade crossing or approaching it, that a train is coming.</p>   

<p>Under the <a href="http://www.fra.dot.gov/downloads/PubAffairs/TRAIN_HORN_RULE_FactSheet.pdf">Train Horn Rule</a>, locomotive engineers must sound train horns for a minimum of 15 seconds, and a maximum of 20 seconds, in advance of all public grade crossings, except:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a train is traveling faster than 45 mph, engineers will not sound the horn until it is within ¼ mile of the crossing, even if the advance warning is less than 15 seconds.</li>
<li>If a train stops in close proximity to a crossing, the horn does not have to be sounded when the train begins to move again.</li> 
<li>There is a “good faith” exception for locations where engineers can’t precisely estimate their arrival at a crossing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wherever feasible, train horns must be sounded in a standardized pattern of 2 long, 1 short, and 1 long. The horn must continue to sound until the lead locomotive or train car occupies the grade crossing.</p>  

<p>A maximum volume level for the train horn has been established at 110 decibels. The minimum sound level remains 96 decibels. Railroads had until 2010 to fully comply with the maximum volume level requirement.</p>

<p>For many communities that are in close proximity to railroads and crossings train horns can be extremely annoying, and on occasion can disrupt an individual’s circadian sleet patterns.    <a href="/factsheets/pdf/MoreInfoTrainHornNoise.pdf">For more information about train horn noise, please click here.</a>.</p> 

<p>One of the best ways to address rail/highway grade crossing safety is to reduce the number of at-grade crossings.   Railroads actively work to close public and private at-grade crossings where possible, working closely with communities and property owners.  According to BNSF, good candidates for closure include grade crossings that are redundant (other crossings nearby allow access to the same roads or areas), are not designated emergency routes, have low traffic volumes, or are private crossings that are no longer needed or used.</p> 

<p>In addition to safety, some of the main benefits of closing grade crossings are fewer traffic delays, idling cars and greenhouse gas emissions.  Most importantly for many communities, closing grade crossings also eliminates noise as whistles are no longer sounded.</p> 

<p>Another policy that communities can also utilize to reduce noise around grade crossing is the implementation of a <a href="/factsheets/?id=quiet_zones">Quiet Zone</a>.  A quiet zone requires the cooperation of the railroad and local government, and it works through the installation of a flashing light and gate automatic warning system.  Once this system in place, a locomotive is not required to sound its horn as it approaches the crossing.  Quiet zones can be established to cover a 24 hour period, or only during the overnight period from 10:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M.</a>

      <div class="sidebar">

</div>
<p>Much of the research conducted on corridor protection and preservation over the past twenty-five years surrounding notes that prior planning for and around corridors (including the mapping of corridors) is a critical element to ensure continued corridor functionality and viability. Local comprehensive plans, MPO long-range plans and state freight plan development processes are the main logical places in which planning should start the process to create a preservation focus. Regional planning and visioning processes are another excellent venue to create a forum to plan for effective corridor protection that also considers freight corridors and major freight facilities.
</p>
<p>Because the possibility that many of the conflicts between freight and other land uses are could be repeated a statewide basis, some states have chosen to take a legislative approach to reduce conflicts that arise because of incompatible land uses adjacent to freight corridors. Although the legislative process can be time consuming and unpredictable, having a state-wide policy to guide future land use decisions around corridors can save time, create stability in the long run and lead to more effective corridor preservation and protection.  
</p>
<p>In some states, advance planning and approval of transportation corridors does not require a change in statutes or regulation.  However, corridor approval will require environmental analyses under the National Environmental Policy Act 1969 (NEPA) to determine and confirm the final corridor location on a map if federal funds are being utilized.   
</p>
<p>Such advanced planning when more land is vacant allows local governments and private parties to better plan developments.  This helps minimize social, economic, and environmental impacts, including the impacts that arise from proximity of potentially incompatible land uses.  Advanced planning is also an excellent preservation tool that can be used in the freight context, because it recognizes the importance of the corridor (and any freight facilities associated with such a corridor).  It provides an excellent mechanism for local jurisdictions to effectively utilize their zoning powers to protect and preserve facilities from development uses that may be incompatible. Advanced planning also provides notice to citizens, property owners, and developers through adoption of an official thoroughfare protection map. 
</p>
<p>The most often cited examples of corridor management legislation include    Florida&#x2019;s 1995 corridor management legislation and      North   Carolina&#x2019;s rail corridor management legislation.

      <p>Statute restricts   development of property adjacent to the corridor:
      </p>
      <p><i>Residential development along a   corridor shall not interfere with the ultimate purpose of the corridor.   Commercial and industrial development along a preserved corridor shall not   adversely impact the corridor. </i>
      </p>
      <p>Statute   restricts interim use of corridor to uses compatible with railroad   development.
      </p>
      <p><i> A city or   county that acquires property to preserve a railroad corridor may lease the   property or use the property for interim compatible uses until the property   is used for a railroad.  </i>

      <p>Local jurisdictions and   the freight railroads with State&#x2019;s assistance have started creating   partnerships to manage interim uses pending re-start of freight   services.  State has greater   understanding of freight rail&#x2019;s business needs which translates into a   successful rail policy.

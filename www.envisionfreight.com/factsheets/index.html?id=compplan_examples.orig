      <p>Most jurisdictions across the U.S. conduct
comprehensive planning activities. New York, Oregon, Florida, Washington, Wisconsin, and
California
are well known for the innovative approaches to land use and planning, and for
the depth of their comprehensive plans. Across the U.S. some jurisdictions are more
proactive than others in assessing how planned development activities will
impact the community. </p>

<h2>Comprehensive Planning & Noise Abatement</h2>

<p>California requires comprehensive
planning (CA code 65103) by cities and counties that must include an assessment
of how the zoning activities—if the plan is built-out—will create noise or
vibration. Under California’s
Government Code (Section 65300-65303.4), the state requires that each planning
agency shall prepare and the legislative body of each county and city shall
adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan for the physical development of
the county or city. Section 65302 notes that the general plan shall consist of
and include a land use element that includes standards of population and
building intensity as well as zoning ordinances to implement its provisions. California’s Regional
Planning law notes that the state has a positive interest in the preparation
and maintenance of a long-term general plan for the physical development of
each of the state’s urban areas. </p>

<p>As an example, Solano County, California,
in its <a href="http://solanocountygeneralplan.net/>2008 General Plan Environmental Impact Report</a>, (<a
href="http://solanocountygeneralplan.net/EIR_04-18-08/9_Section%204.3%20-%20Noise.pdf">Chapter
4.3 - Noise</a>) reviewed the use of zoning elements as well as unit design
specifications as it assessed elements required to abate projected noise
increases.  These included the use of setbacks,
barriers, berms, and also site design to reduce the effects of incompatible
uses. The plan notes that buildings can be placed upon a site to shield other
structures and reduce noise level caused by reflections—for example, carports
or garages—or residential units placed to shield one another can be useful
reduction measures close to transportation infrastructure. The plan also notes
that site design should review options to use a commercial or storage zoning
category between a noise source and a sensitive use area.   
Solana County also discussed the potential effects from freight rail activity and air
transport activity in the Transportation Chapter (<a
href="http://solanocountygeneralplan.net/GP%20Documents/12-15-08/Chapter_7%20-%20Transportation%20&%20Circulation.pdf">Chapter
7</a>) of the General Plan.</p>

<p>The Cities of Portland OR, San Francisco CA, and Madison
WI also have comprehensive plans that discuss freight in a critical manner and
set out objectives and goals to achieve better freight land use
coordination.   New York has had a waterfront development
plan in place for over twenty years that also provides a good conceptual view
of how marine and port activities fit into the city’s economic base.  Selected best practice items
from within these documents are listed below. </p>

      <h1><a href="/factsheets/default.aspx">Fact Sheets</a>: Dredging</h1>
      
      <p>Dredging refers to the artificial removal of sediment from the bottom of a riverbed or other body of water, such as an ocean floor.  It is performed in order to temporarily deepen a navigable body of water so as to allow a vessel to freely move without damaging its keel.  Sometimes dredging is used to correct irregularities in the sea floor or riverbed to create a uniform depth.  To be successful, a dredging operation must remove the sediment and deposit it in an area that will not allow it to resettle at the bottom.  The difficulty in removing dredge material depends on the type sediment to be removed, and the depth at which the operation is occurring.  Other factors influencing cost include environmental restrictions that impact the rate at which sediment can be removed. Suction dredging is typically the most economical dredge process.  Figure 1 shows a suction dredge vessel under operation.</p>

<p>Dredging issues are a common point of contention in determining the optimal balance of between freight and non-freight uses of waterways.  In general, dredging is split into two distinct types:</p>
<ul>  
<li>Capital, or new work, dredging projects are projects in which a channel is being made deeper or wider.</li> 
<li>Maintenance dredging refers to activity to maintain the present the authorized dimensions of a channel when siltation has occurred.</li>
</ul>  
<p>For a number of reasons, capital dredging projects are more controversial than are maintenance dredging projects.  One reason is that capital dredging is more costly due to the greater probability of encountering varied or rocky soil.  Secondly, capital projects, particularly in the marine environment, have the potential to disturb ecosystems that inhabit the seafloor.  Finally, capital dredging projects that deepen a channel are sometimes seen as gateway for more intensive freight usage of an area.</p> 
<p>Finding suitable locations for dredge material disposal is another pressing concern.  The issue is particularly controversial when the dredged soil is contaminated and potentially harmful to human health. Remote disposal of dredge material can dramatically drive up the total cost of the operation.</p>
<h2>Dredging Costs</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.ndc.iwr.usace.army.mil/dredge/ddcosts.htm">The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers keeps detailed records on dredging projects around the country and historical records going back to 1963.</a>   The data shows the cost of maintenance dredging, in constant dollar terms, has been increasing since 1990. Thus, it is becoming more considerably more costly to maintain the existing system of dredged channels in the United States.</p>

      <h1><a href="default.aspx.html">Fact Sheets</a>: Airport Noise Mitigation Programs</h1>
      
      <p>By far the most pressing issue that airports face is
noise.  Incompatible land uses near
airports are a major concern and challenge for all airport operations (freight
and passenger).  This is complicated
though, by multiple layers of oversight and regulation that cover airports,
their operations, flight paths, planning, land use decisions, community
outreach, and growth opportunities juxtaposed with the goals of many airport
operators, commercial carriers, and economic development groups who are often
focused on increasing revenues and maximizing the utility and operation of the
airport.</p>

<p>The primary responsibility for integrating airport
considerations into land use planning lies with local jurisdictions.  This according to Government Accountability Office
in 2000 presents difficulties for many airports, as they cannot control
development in surrounding communities and yet are held to account by these
communities when airport noise adversely affects uses such as homes, schools,
and churches that get built close to airports.  
</p>

<h2>Federal Role</h2>

<p>The Federal Aviation Administration (<a href="http://www.faa.gov/">FAA</a>) governs aspects of airport activities, including
developing the national airport system plan, airspace authorization, and air
traffic control, permitting process for new airports and airport certification,
aircraft and airline, and pilot licensing, aircraft noise abatement oversight,
aircraft safety, and security.</p>

<p>The FAA has set standards for noise levels, and programs that
can be utilized to redress these issues and has also issued multiple items of
guidance regarding noise mitigation and land uses that have been identified as
incompatible with airport activities.  However,
in much the same way as is seen across other freight modes, because the
jurisdictional responsibility for implementing land use planning and zoning
lies with local jurisdictions, unless these entities are part of any noise
reduction or abatement program, or involved in planning activities problems may
well arise.  </p>

<p>In 1979 the Aviation Safety and Noise Abatement Act (49
U.S.C. 47501 et.seq.) created the first pilot program where the Federal
government funded up to 24 noise control plans a year. This was expanded in the
1980s and 1990s and by the end of the century the FAA Airport Improvement
Program grants had over $2.6 billion.  The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 was
another pivotal piece of legislation recognizing the need for a national
aviation noise policy.  A critical part
of the statute was direction to eliminate the use of older, noisier “Stage 2”
aircraft weighing more than 75,000 pounds in the contiguous U.S. after
December 31, 1999.  The final revision
and rules of this act were established in September 1991 as Part 91.  Another important element of the noise policy
is the Notice and Approval Airport Noise and Access Restrictions, Part 161 that
establishes a program for reviewing airport noise and access restrictions on
the use of “Stage 2” and newer, quieter “Stage 3” aircraft.   </p>

<p>Finally, what is known as the FAA’s Part 150 program is
another critical noise and land use program. 
Airport operators develop comprehensive noise and land use compatibility
programs.  The programs identify noise
mitigation projects and procedures to reduce aviation noise.  Part 150 is a voluntary program that
‘encourages’ airport operators to develop noise exposure maps and noise
compatibility programs.  These identify
noise contours and land use incompatibilities.    The FAA then determines if the 150 study is
in accordance and once this is authorized an airport operator can then apply
for grants for studies and for airport noise compatibility projects.  As at year-end 2007 there were 271 airports
participating in the program, and 238 had an approved noise compatibility
program (NPIAS, 2009 Update). </p>

<p>The noise impacted projects include residential and public
building sound insulation, land acquisition, and the relocation of residents
from significantly noise impacted areas. 
As part of this many airports have acquired noise monitoring equipment
and installed noise barriers to reduce ground run-up noise and have created
Noise Roundtables comprised of stakeholders from the airport, local politicians,
and local residents to ensure that these programs run smoothly.   </p>

<p>Airport noise mitigation programs have occurred at
multiple airports around the U.S. <a href="pdf/LouisvilleCaseStudy.pdf">Louisville Kentucky (the third largest
all-cargo airport in the U.S. by landed weight and one of the larger hubs for
Fed-Ex and UPS) has an extensive noise-mitigation program, community noise
forum, and has undertaken large noise-based community relocation programs.</a></p>

      <h1><a href="/factsheets/default.aspx">Fact Sheets</a>: Corridor Management Initiatives</h1>
      
      <p>Corridor management initiatives (CMI) are extremely important exercises that bring together multiple stakeholders to develop solutions, combine funding, and improve freight corridor management.   Similar to noise roundtables and other community forums, CMIs also provide opportunities to engage local communities through committee membership and create educational outreach about the value of freight to the local, regional, and national economy.    Through their educational element, CMIs also provide opportunities for local and regional planning organizations to better consider freight as they develop comprehensive plans and adopt zoning amendments to ensure land use incompatibilities can be reduced in the future.  Examples of single state, multi-state and private sector CMIs are provided below.</p>

<h2>Single State Corridor Management Initiatives</h2>

<p>Vermont created a <a href="http://www.aot.state.vt.us/planning/VTcorridor.htm">Corridor Management Handbook</a> (CMH) in 2005 to provide a technical resource for state and regional agency planners and their consultants who are undertaking development of transportation corridor management plans.  The CMH was also considered to be helpful for a broader set of people who are involved in corridor planning efforts - local officials; planning, zoning, and public works staff; transit service providers; corridor residents and business people; and other interested parties.</p>

<p>According to the Vermont Agency of Transportation:</p>  

<p class="quote">The idea for this handbook grew out of the recognition that many of Vermont's transportation needs can be most effectively addressed at the corridor level rather than on a piecemeal basis. Limited resources for transportation improvements at all levels of government are dictating more creative and collaborative approaches to solving - and preventing transportation problems.  A corridor approach offers the opportunity for communities to collectively plot a future strategy which makes the best possible use of available resources, takes advantage of synergies to produce the best outcomes, and has a greater chance of becoming a reality - than would otherwise be the case if each community acted on its own.</p>

<p>Chicago’s <a href="http://www.createprogram.org/">CREATE</a> initiative is another multi-year project centered in a single state.   Begun in 2003, the project is currently underway. As of 2010, ten projects have been completed.  CREATE is a  partnership between the U.S. DOT, the State of Illinois, the City of Chicago, Metra, Amtrak, and all the Class I railroads.  Railroad partners contributed $100 million to the initiative in 2005, and the highway trust fund legislation authorized $100 million for CREATE in 2005.  The first federal funding for the initiative was released in 2007, and in 2010 CREATE received high speed rail funds and American Recovery Reinvestment Act TIGER grants.</p>  

<p>CREATE will invest in infrastructure improvements to improve the efficiency of the rail infrastructure in the Chicago region.  This is expected to reduce the congestion and train delays that Chicago currently contends with, and also mitigate some of the environmental impacts from freight.   CREATE is focusing on multiple corridors that intersect and create the freight network within the Chicago area.   The CREATE program comprises the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>254 road/rail grade separations</li>
<li>6 passenger/freight rail grade separations</li>
<li>Railroad projects to improve rail infrastructure and upgrade technologies</li>
<li>Viaduct improvement program</li>
<li>Grade crossing safety enhancements</li>
<li>Rail operations and visibility improvements</li>
</ul>
<p>Established in 1998, the <a href="http://www.psrc.org/transportation/freight/fast/">Freight Action Strategy for the Everett-Seattle Tacoma Corridor (FAST) Partnership</a>, has been pursuing funding for twenty-five high-priority projects for transportation improvements along the railroad mainline and truck corridors near the Puget Sound ports between Everett and Tacoma.  Fourteen projects have been completed with additional projects underway.</p>  

<p>FAST is a partnership of state, local, and regional agencies, including Puget Sound ports, railroads, and the trucking industry. Its goals are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve mainline rail capacity and connectivity</li>
<li>Eliminate roadway chokepoints where rail and arterial roads intersect</li>
<li>Provide safe rail crossings in communities</li>
<li>Establish reliable truck links between ports, rail yards, and freight distribution centers.</li>
</ul>  

<p>The Port of Seattle committed to contributing about $30 million to the program. To date, it has authorized about $14 million of contributions for FAST corridor partners' projects.</p> 

<p><a href="http://www.tampabayfreight.com/"Tampa Bay Regional Goods Movement Study</a> was initiated by Florida’s Department of Transportation District 7.  A website was created to provide local government, freight stakeholders, and the public with information regarding freight.  As part of this project a <a href="http://www.tampabayfreight.com/database/database.html">Regional Goods Movement Database</a> was developed.  A freight corridor screening process and guidelines were also developed to evaluate the use of the state highways and other highways in the Tampa Bay area.  The freight corridor screening methodology can be seen in Figure 1.</p>

<h2>Multi-State Corridor Initiatives</h2>

<p>There have been many multi-state CMIs over the years, but only one has a distinctly freight focus.  The I-10 National Freight Corridor Study was initiated in 2001 and managed by the transportation agencies in the eight states through which I-10 traverses. A comprehensive evaluation of the overall corridor system was conducted.  The study assessed the need for, and feasibility of, a broad range of options to facilitate the movement of goods along the corridor.  The study:</p>
<ul>  
<li>Gathered information about freight movement</li> 
<li>Inventoried the physical condition of the interstate</li> 
<li>Identified operational problems for all motorists on I-10, and</li> 
<li>Determined what improvements can be made to ease congestion and enhance safety.</li>
</ul> 

<p>The study also gathered information about how truck traffic along I-10 affects air quality, highway safety, road maintenance, and the economies and job markets in the communities linked to the corridor. Although the study focused primarily on freight movement along I-10, consideration was given to roadways that feed I-10 from large freight moving areas, such as manufacturing and distribution centers, sea ports, air cargo facilities, and railroad intermodal yards.  This project created an <a href="http://www.i10freightstudy.org/">interactive tour</a> where visitors to the website can find the major metro areas served by I-10 and the port, airports and rail facility freight components.  Not only are such tools extremely important both from a corridor management perspective, but they also to educate the general public, and other local planning officials about the working of the corridor’s freight transportation system.   The I-10 study has taken a long-term view of corridor management.  The multi-state study began phasing in recommended strategies in 2008 and this is planned to continue till 2025.</p> 

<h2>Private Sector Initiatives</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nascocorridor.com/">North American Super Corridor Coalition, Inc (NASCO)</a> was created in 1994 to unite public and private sectors to address critical national and international trade, transportation, security, and environmental issues.   Following the I-35 corridor through the central United States, and into eastern and central Canada and Mexico, the initiative covers a multi-modal transportation network that connects 71 million people and over a $1 trillion dollars in commerce between the three nations.</p>  

<p>NASCO members include cities, counties, states, provinces, and the private sector from all three countries.   NASCO hosts committees in its three main focus areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation Efficiency and Security</li>
<li>Energy and Environmental Quality</li>
<li>Entry-level Logistics Workforce Development</li>
</ul>

<p>The Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad rolled out its <a href="http://www.corridorsofcommerce.com/explore-the-corridors/">Corridors of Commerce</a> initiative in 2010.   This website provides information on the benefits of rail, the three major corridors of the BNSF network (Mid Continent Corridor, Great Northern Corridor and the Transcon), and other information regarding railroad corridors.  BNSF will work with the public sector to expand and improve these corridors of commerce. This will include improvements to relieve chokepoints on the national rail system.</p>  

<p>Another Railroad that is extremely active in CMI’s is the <a href="http://www.ncrr.com/">North Carolina Railroad (NCRR)</a>.   Established by Charter of the North Carolina State Legislature in 1849 it operates a 317 mile corridor.  Norfolk Southern and Amtrak runs trains over the NCRRs right of way.   The NCRR has a <a href="http://www.ncrr.com/ncrr-corridor-brochure.pdf">Corridor Management Brochure</a>, and is actively involved in over eleven corridor management initiatives, including mapping, notification, educational outreach about the corridor, and working with local jurisdictions.</p>

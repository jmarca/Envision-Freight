      <h1><a href="/factsheets/default.aspx">Fact Sheets</a>: Construction Requirements For Noise Reduction</h1>
      
      <p>Homes can be constructed to
withstand noise and vibration and achieve a reduction in noise level to
acceptable levels.   In many instances,
airport land-use plans have developed construction requirements to achieve
sound level reduction, and have produced guidebooks and other useful
instructional material to guide the city as they issue development permits.   </p>

<p>In 2010, the <a href="http://www.iccsafe.org/Pages/default.aspx">International Code Council</a>
(ICC) produced a new Guideline for Acoustics. 
The guide provides two grades of acoustical performance: acceptable and
preferred performance levels for air-borne and structure-borne noise. Both
recommendations exceed the current code minimum.  Specific design and evaluation techniques for
managing the degradation of sound-rated material that is installed in buildings
are also provided in this guideline.</p>

<p>Some states also have their own
set of building codes for example, <a href="http://www.bsc.ca.gov/title_24/t24_2001tried.htm">California</a>,
<a href="http://www.floridabuilding.org/c/default.aspx">Florida</a>,
<a href="http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=eopsterminal&L=4&L0=Home&L1=Consumer+Protection+%26+Business+Licensing&L2=License+Type+by+Business+Area&L3=Construction+Supervisor+License&sid=Eeops&b=terminalcontent&f=dps_bbrs_building_code&csid=Eeops">Massachusetts</a>,
<a href="http://www.michigan.gov/dleg/0,1607,7-154-10575---,00.html">Michigan</a>,
and <a href="http://www.dos.state.ny.us/code/title19.htm">New York</a>.
Florida is currently <a href="http://www.dca.state.fl.us/fbc/thecode/1_code_modifications.htm">updating</a>
its building code, and <a href="http://www.michigan.gov/documents/dleg/dleg_bcc_2009_009lg_building_residential_code_rules_337947_7.pdf">Michigan</a>
will have new rules take effect March 9, 2011. 
</p>

<div class="sidebar_left">
  <p>Sound
    Transmission Class is a single number rating of the sound transmission loss
    (reduction of sound energy passing through building material) of a wall, or
    structure, which accounts for the variation in noise transmission loss with
    frequency.</p>
</div>
    
<p><a href="/factsheets/pdf/ScottMidAmericaLandUseStudy.pdf">Scott Air Force Base and Mid-America St.
Louis Airport conducted a joint land-use study</a> released in  August 2008 that developed a series of tables
(from material that was prepared for Wright-Patterson Air Force Base) to
achieve specific sound noise level reduction through the use of Sound
Transmission Class types of building construction elements.</p>

<p>Chicago’s <a href="http://www.ohare.com/cnrc/ohare/ohareresidential.htm">O’Hare
International Airport</a> also has a useful pdf guide on construction materials
to reduce noise.   Its website provides
information and resources for homeowners and also has a <a href="http://www.ohare.com/cnrc/ohare/ORDSoundInsulating2010.02.pdf.">sound
insulating brochure</a> produced in 2010. 
The guidebook was developed as a response to the many requests
that the city had received, and was created by the City’s Department of
Aviation, Airport Owners Representatives, City’s consultant to the Residential
Sound Insulation Program and the O’Hare Noise Compatibility Commissions
Committee.  The brochure provides
detailed schematics of the types of mitigation that can be utilized to reduce
noise.  </p>

<p>Building a
new home with additional sound attenuation is more expensive.  However, there are also other design
considerations that can also be utilized that have little to no cost associated
with them.  For example, locating
bedrooms away from noise sources, and positioning less-used rooms, such as the
bathroom and closets, between the noise source and the noise sensitive rooms.   The Scott
Air Force/Base Mid-America Airport land-use study estimated that the cost of constructing a sound-
attenuated home in proximity to their facility would be between $5,000
and $10,000 to achieve a reduction of noise of 25 decibels. <a href="/factsheets/pdf/ConstructionRequirements.pdf">Examples of construction
requirements can be found
here.</a></p>

<p>The benefits of constructing a
home with sound/vibration attenuation are multiple.   Benefits include the reduction of potential
community/freight group conflicts and the improved quality of life for
residents.</p>

<p>Another important element that aligns
with construction techniques is the use of buffer areas between the freight
activity/corridor and the incompatible land use.    Research conducted by Canada’s Railway
Proximity Website, the Center for Transportation Research at The University of
Texas at Austin, and California’s Air 
Resources Board have developed <a href="/factsheets/pdf/BufferDistanceTables.pdf">tables of recommended buffer distances
between certain land uses and freight activity</a>.</p>

<h2>Other Useful Sites</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nahb.org/page.aspx/category/sectionID=223">National
Association of Home Builders</a> is also a good resource for construction codes
and standards.  <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dob/html/reference/code_internet.shtml">New York
City’s</a> Building Code created in 1968 is a good resource.  The <a
href="http://www.epa.gov/radon/rrnc/association_contacts.html">EPA</a> also has
a list of State Building Code Associations.   
The <a href="http://www.energycodes.gov/states/">U.S. Department of Energy</a> also has
useful links to state energy codes which often as a byproduct improve noise
reduction. </p>

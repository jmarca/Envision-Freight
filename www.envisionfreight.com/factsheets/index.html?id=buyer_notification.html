      <h1><a href="default.aspx.html">Fact Sheets</a>: Buyer Notification and Awareness Measures</h1>

      <p>One useful tool that should be utilized more frequently for property that is developed or already is situated around freight facilities, is notice to the purchaser that the property sits within a ‘freight influence&#x2019; area that may be subject to nuisance type activity such as noise, vibration, dust, light, and pollution.</p>
<p>This already occurs in many jurisdictions around airport property, where airport zones of influence ordinances have been created and where an aircraft overflight easement exists that consents to overflying aircraft.  These easements also usually prevent present and future property owners/occupants from objecting to—or seeking damages from—aircraft operations.  Some easements also restrict property owners/occupiers from installation structures, trees, or other objects that may interfere with airport operations due to their height.  The main measures that are used around airports are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aviation Easement - transfers certain property rights from the owner of the underlying property to the airport, or local government agency on behalf of the federal government for military airports.</li>
<li>Recorded Deed Notice - a form of buyer awareness measure to ensure that prospective buyers of property are aware of the airport&#x2019;s impact on the property.  This type of notice does not convey any rights and does not restrict height; it merely document the existence of certain conditions that affect the property because of over flights and airport traffic pattern altitude.</li>
<li>Real Estate Disclosure - a more all-encompassing form of buyer awareness that would be disclosed to all prospective buyers of an airport-vicinity property before title is transferred.  Its advantage lies in that it applies to previously existing land uses, as well as any new development.</li>
</ul>
<p>Capital Metro Transit Agency in Austin, Texas has developed a process to work with the City of Austin when it receives any applications for site plan approval, zoning variances, or other city development office applications for property within 500 feet of their corridor (which is a shared-use corridor that also has freight traffic).  This process was developed after community complaints came in around the railroad maintenance yard in northwest Austin.  As part of this process, once the city receives a notice, a copy is mailed to the transit agency, who will review it to see if it warrants a notice regarding rail activity.  If the proposed development application will be affected by rail activity, a notice will be sent to the applicant and property owner (with a copy to the city).  This will also be logged into a log of development notices that the transit agency has developed.  If the property owner responds to the letter the transit agency will answer any questions.</p>
<p>Freight railroads have begun to engage with local jurisdictions and the real-estate community to develop better notification procedures regarding their activities.  For example, the CSX railroad has been working with Baltimore, Maryland&#x2019;s real estate community to add disclosure notices to standard real-estate contracts where the property is located near railroad or industrial operations that may include operation of machinery, trucks, and railroads 24 hours per day, seven days a week.   The North Carolina Railroad also has an active corridor management initiative program that engages the planning, real estate, and trade and professional associations to provide information regarding their efforts and goals to protect the rail corridor.</p>

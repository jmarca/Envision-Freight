      <h1><a href="default.aspx.html">Fact Sheets</a>: Resources and Materials for Developing a Comprehensive Plan</h1>
      
      <p>There are many useful resources and guides provided by the states on to how to develop a comprehensive plan.  The Governor’s Office of Planning and Research California <a href="http://www.opr.ca.gov/planning/publications/General_Plan_Guidelines_2003.pdf">General Plan Guidelines 2003</a>, is a good resource to consider utilizing, as California requires a noise evaluation to be considered in the comprehensive plan, and this will require analysis of freight systems and facilities.  <a href="http://monvalleyhelp.com/resource/freight-movement">Mon Valley Pennsylvania Land Use & Transportation Website</a>’s freight movement section also provides a useful starting point for integrating freight planning into the comprehensive plan (this was adapted from Pennsylvania’s Department of Transportation’s Transportation and Land Use Tool).</p>   
<p>Industrial Inventories are also an extremely useful item for a city/county to develop and map out industrial facilities and the major freight corridors and facilities.  They also often provide an excellent baseline to show the value of freight within the local/regional economy for example highlighting taxes, wages, and building permits issued.   As part of industrial inventory activities local jurisdictions should conduct an internet search to see if any freight plans may have been developed by the State Department of Transportation or the Metropolitan Planning Association, or other Freight Stakeholder or Freight Taskforce groups.  These may provide good starting points, and in some instances may have GIS layering that can be used within the inventory process of the comprehensive plan to develop freight facility and corridor location maps..  Freight Task Groups may also have developed maps that show critical bottlenecks and areas where freight facilities are close to environmental justice communities.   For example, the Atlanta Regional Commission in its development of its <a href="http://www.atlantaregional.com/transportation/freight/freight-mobility-plan/freight-mobility-plan">Regional Freight Mobility Plan</a> in 2007 had multiple freight stakeholders involved in the committee’s that provided technical and policy advice to the consultants developing the plan.  These groups provided examples of bottlenecks, discussion of how design elements in mixed use areas were impeding efficient freight delivery, and also mapped out where the environmental justice communities were located in extremely close proximity to freight facilities and corridors.</p>  
<p>Examples of industrial inventories include <a href="http://www.sf-planning.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=8341">San Francisco Commerce and Industry Inventory</i>, released in October 2010, and the State of Oregon’s 2003 Land Conservation Development Commission and Economic Revitalization Team, which reported on the <a href="http://www.oregon.gov/LCD/docs/economicdevelopment/indconvrep.pdf?ga=t">Conversion of Industrial Land to Nonindustrial Land</a>. They released their report in 2004 and found that the state had an interest in preserving a supply of prime industrial land for short and long term needs.   Portland Oregon has also undertaking ongoing reviews of its industrial land inventory, including a <a href="http://www.sf-planning.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=8341">market demand analysis</a> for the citywide industrial lands inventory and assessment and a review of <a href="http://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/PortlandsWorkingRivers_CarlAbbott_WhitePaper.pdf">Portland’s Working Rivers</a> in 2008.  <a href="http://www.pdc.us/pdf/bus_serv/CILI-report-final_7-31-03.pdf">Industrial Inventories were undertaken in 2003</a> and 2005 and the city created an <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/bps/index.cfm?c=47561&a=71533">Industrial District Atlas</a> and developed a <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?c=38846">Master Freight Plan</a> in 2006.   Many cities’ economic development groups and chambers of commerce may also have industrial inventories that the city can utilize as it develops its industrial plan, for example East Tennessee Development District created an <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?c=38846">Industrial Land Inventory</a> in June 2009 that gave details on tract size and acres, service by utilities and service by rail and barge.  The city of Chanhassen, Minnesota in March 2010 created a <a href="http://www.ci.chanhassen.mn.us/serv/maps/landinv.pdf">land inventory map</a>, which included current available land, which can also be utilized to determine where new freight and industrial areas should be created.</p> 
<p>It is recommended that all local jurisdictions develop appropriate maps for use in determining the areas in which new industrial/freight activity should be encouraged to locate, and to provide information if any zoning variance applications are made to the City’s Planning Commission.  These maps should be updated no less often than the comprehensive plan.</p>

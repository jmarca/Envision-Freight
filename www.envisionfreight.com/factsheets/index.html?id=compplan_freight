      <h1><a href="/factsheets/default.aspx">Fact Sheets</a>: Incorporating Freight into a Comprehensive Plan</h1>
      
      <p>Freight is one element that is often missing within the enabling act specifications  of goals to be reviewed.  Without a defined goal for freight, local jurisdictions may often overlook the importance of freight in their community, and may not carry out an adequate review of where freight facilities are located or planned, or what the needs of, and risks to, such facilities might be.  This in turn leads to inadequate zoning provisions to reduce incompatible uses around freight facilities and corridors, protect corridors into the future, and protect freight and industrial areas from conversion to non-industrial type uses.  Lack of focus on freight has also historically led to environmental justice issues that low income communities or communities of color face because their communities were developed in close proximity to industrial and freight activities.</p>
<p>Ideally, freight modes, and facilities should be specifically delineated within the details of the enabling act as to what should be included in the contents of a Comprehensive Plan.</p>  
<p>Freight can be more effectively incorporated in the Comprehensive Plan through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Specific mapping of freight facilities, yards, distribution and logistics areas, and corridors should also be undertaken at this point.  This could be conducted as an industrial inventory exercise, that also produced data and statistics on the volume of goods moving within the region, principal arterials, marine, and rail corridors that are used, and data on employment, taxes and other financial elements.  The output from this exercise could be utilized within multiple areas of the comprehensive plan, including transportation; land use and economic development.</li>      
<li>In addition to collecting freight data, the city should engage with freight groups to learn about freight’s needs for the future, the critical chokepoints that currently exist, and other issues that may arise, for example any community complaints that the freight groups may have received.  These can then be analyzed and integrated into the comprehensive plans goals, objectives, policies and maps.</li>
<li>Include freight-related provisions in the plan.  A new freight element may be appropriate, or freight could be included in the land use, transportation, and economic development elements.  The plan should deal with protecting current freight systems from incompatible uses and capacity problems, and should also consider needed future freight facilities.</li>
<li>Cities and counties should include freight stakeholders when they conduct outreach on the comprehensive plan.  Ideally the local jurisdiction would request that a freight stakeholder be in attendance at public hearings and at sessions that may be held by the consultants conducting the outreach regarding mapping.  They could (i) provide information to roundtables and groups that may be created to guide the development of the comprehensive plan; and (ii) ensure that freight issues and freight needs are considered within the plan process.</li>
</ol>    

<h2>Guidelines for Developing Comprehensive Plan Freight Components</h2> 
<p>The General or Comprehensive Plan is usually made up of these main areas: Goals, Objectives, Policies, and Maps.  These intersect and align to create a comprehensive plan. There may be separate areas within the comprehensive plan dealing with different elements; for example, a “land use element” and a “transportation element” may be separate sections of the plan. Both of these elements are relevant to freight.    In addition the “economic development element” will also have ramifications for freight groups.</p>  
<p><i>Goals</i> are a direction setting element.  They will describe an idea future that the community wishes to attain that will be related to public health, safety or general welfare.  The goals will encapsulate general expressions of community values and may not be quantifiable or time-specific or dependent.  Examples of freight goals could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A diversified economic base for the city,</li> 
<li>Encourage global freight connectivity as the [x] largest logistics hub in the U.S,</li> 
<li>Protection of freight facilities, or freight corridors to ensure a continued viable economic base for the city.</li>
</ul> 

<p><i>Objectives</i> will be a specific, delineated end, state or condition that is a step in attaining the goals set within the plan.   An objective should be achievable and have some type of performance metric that is measurable and time-specific.  Examples for freight could be:</p>
<ul> 
<li>mapping of all freight corridors and associated and ancillary facilities by [x] date;</li> 
<li>a reduction in freight related pollutants around port facilities;</li> 
<li>a 50 percent reduction in industrial land conversion over the next [x] years.</li> 
<li>First Street and Harbor Avenue are designated as major trucking arterials</li>
<li>A new Logistics Center Park will be located in the area bounded by E and H Avenues and Commerce Drive.</li>
</ul>  

<p><i>Policies</i> are specific statements that guide decision making within the comprehensive plan. Policies that are clear help in judging whether zoning decisions, projects, public works activities and other projects are consistent with the general plan.   Examples of a policy from the freight perspective could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The city shall not approve a zoning ordinance variance to rezone industrial to residential uses that is located within 300 feet of the identified railroad corridors, logistics zone, or port facility.</li>  
<li>The city will not approve or permit distribution center or logistics facility development adjacent to schools, hospitals, residential care facilities, libraries and emergency service stations.</li> 
<li>The city will not approve the placement of hospitals, schools, residential care facilities, libraries and emergency service stations within 500 feet of any freight facility that operates on a 24 hour basis.</li>
<li>Residential neighborhoods within a city should not be placed in proximity to, or adjacent to port facilities, rail yards, rail corridors, and heavily trucked routes.</li>
<li>Schools should not be placed close to railroad tracks to reduce trespass.</li>
<li>The minimal acceptable level of service (e.g. peak hour level of service) for major truck thoroughfares.</li>
<li>The city will develop minimum setback and buffer standards for any new sensitive land use that may be developed close to freight facilities.</li>
<li>The city will adopt a specific plan for the logistics park.</li>
<li>Areas designated for freight activity should be placed in industrial/freight zone areas.</li>
<li>The city will develop a financing program to implement the highway at-grade crossing closure program.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some comprehensive plans may include “Implementation Measures” which are the action, program, procedure or technique that will carry out the general/comprehensive plan’s policy.   For example, <a href="http://www.opr.ca.gov/planning/publications/General_Plan_Guidelines_2003.pdf">California's guidance on developing comprehensive plans</a> notes that “all policies developed should have at least one implementation measure."</p>

<p><i>Maps</i> will be developed to accompany the comprehensive plan.  These will often show land uses, current and future transportation corridors, urban design features, and geologic and other natural hazards.   Aerial maps and other photographic elements will often be placed within the comprehensive/general plan sections.   A comprehensive/general plan that effectively addresses freight would conduct a ‘freight inventory’ that shows major freight corridors (highway/rail), logistics and distribution center facilities, major industrial and manufacturing hubs that are utilizing the multimodal system, ports and marine facilities and terminals, rail yards, large container storage areas, major air cargo facilities, navigation easements and runway approaches, and connecting highways used by trucks to access air cargo facilities. The comprehensive plan should also designate future corridors, needed improvements to corridors, and future expansion of other freight facilities.</p>    
<p>The comprehensive plan should also take into consideration (i) items that are placed into the Transportation Improvement Plans that the Metropolitan Planning Agencies are required to prepare under federal law; and (ii) the state transportation plans that will often have a freight multimodal component.  This will ensure that the comprehensive plan and any land use plans created as a consequence of the comprehensive plan effectively consider transportation goals, policies and projects that are being conducted at the regional and statewide level.</p>

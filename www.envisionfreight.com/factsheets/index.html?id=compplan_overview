      <h1><a href="/factsheets/default.aspx">Fact Sheets</a>: Comprehensive Plans Overview</h1>
      
      <p>The power to regulate land uses—except where limited by federal law—is primarily a power “reserved” for the states under the United States Constitution. Most states have delegated this power to local municipalities and counties under the planning and zoning enabling laws enacted by state legislatures.</p> 
<p>Most issues about future land uses impinging on, or negatively impacting, the present or future viability of freight facilities arise from, or come to a head, in the context of zoning or development site plan approvals. Similarly the conflicts – and nuisance complaints such as noise, vibration etc – that  arise from the perspective of residential communities and other land uses such as hospitals, residential care facilities and schools also arise because of unintended consequences of allowing these uses to be sited too close to freight. The city or county’s comprehensive plan (also called a general plan in some places) is intended, and in most places required, to guide these zoning and site plan decisions. The comprehensive plan also sets expectations as to the allowed use of land in various locations, and developers and builders may make investment decisions based on that plan.</p>
<p>The comprehensive plan should:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide vision of the long-term future character and design of a community</li>
<li>Show the importance and interrelatedness of many topics</li>
<li>Cover a wide geographic area, and show interdependencies among geographic areas</li>
<li>Show potential long term impacts</li>
<li>Represent the interests of a broad range of citizens and stakeholders.<a href="#fn1">[1]</a></li>   
</ul>

<p>Ideally local zoning practices should also align with the goals, objectives, and policies of the comprehensive plan, and in many places such alignment is mandated.</p>  
<h2>Items to Include in the Comprehensive Plan</h2>
<p>In many states, the statutes mandate a list of elements that must or may be included in comprehensive plans. This list is generally contained in a section of the state code referred to as the “zoning enabling act.”</p> 
<p>Some states also set out very specific elements to be included in the comprehensive plan.  Wisconsin, for example, identified 14 goals that it requires in the comprehensive plans that it requires all communities in Wisconsin to prepare (s. 66.1001, Wis. Stats.)</p>
<ol>  
<li>Promotion of the redevelopment of lands with existing infrastructure and public services and the maintenance and rehabilitation of existing residential, commercial and industrial structures.
<li>Encouragement of neighborhood designs that support a range of transportation choices.</li> 
<li>Protection of natural areas, including wetlands, wildlife habitats, lakes, woodlands, open spaces, and groundwater resources.</li> 
<li>Protection of economically productive areas, including farmland and forests.</li> 
<li>Encouragement of land uses, densities and regulations that promote efficient development patterns and relatively low municipal, state governmental and utility costs.</li> 
<li>Preservation of cultural, historic and archaeological sites.</li> 
<li>Encouragement of coordination and cooperation among nearby units of government.</li> 
<li>Building of community identity by revitalizing main streets and enforcing design standards.</li> 
<li>Providing an adequate supply of affordable housing for individuals of all income levels throughout each community.</li> 
<li>Providing adequate infrastructure and public services and an adequate supply of developable land to meet existing and future market demand for residential, commercial and industrial uses.</li> 
<li>Promoting the expansion or stabilization of the current economic base and the creation of a range of employment opportunities at the state, regional and local levels.</li> 
<li>Balancing individual property rights with community interests and goals.</li> 
<li>Planning and development of land uses that create or preserve varied and unique urban and rural communities.</li> 
<li>Providing an integrated, efficient and economical transportation system that affords mobility, convenience and safety and that meets the needs of all citizens, including transit–dependent and disabled citizens.</li>
</ol>

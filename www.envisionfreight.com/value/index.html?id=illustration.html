      <h1><a href="default.aspx.html">The Value of Freight</a>: Effects of Capacity Constraints on Congestion</h1>
      
      <p>The expected travel times of shipments and the variance of these expected travel times (i.e., reliability) is a reflection of the transportation network's capacity and the degree of network congestion.  Both capacity and congestion are affected by the degree of encroachment of freight corridors and facilities.  If congestion increases the average travel time or its variance, the level of transportation service declines.  The degree to which shippers respond to increased congestion with changes in logistics choices is dependent upon the degree to which logistics inputs, including alternative transportation modes, can be substituted for each other.  The responsiveness of transportation demand with respect to changes in congestion is typically smaller in the short run than in the long run.  For example, suppose that there is a reduction in congestion levels for a particular rail corridor due to the resolution of encroachment issues, such as the elimination of grade crossings.  In the very short run, contractual commitments and production schedules may limit the degree to which the firm can take advantage of this reduced congestion.  In a slightly longer timeframe, the firm may be able to shift some of its highway transportation to this now less congested rail corridor. In the longer run, firms may decide to relocate production operations and warehouses to make further use of that rail corridor.  This will lead to further shifts in transportation utilization across modes and corridors.</p>

        <p>One of the obvious causes of congestion on freight corridors is increased traffic.  Given that most corridors are shared use, this includes both freight and passenger volumes.  However, major contributions to congestion also include insufficient transportation capacity and/or inability to expand capacity.  These capacity constraints are often related to encroachment issues such as physical barriers and incompatible adjacent land uses, particularly in densely populated areas. The GAO study reports that areas surrounding critical freight infrastructure are increasingly dense with development, making it more difficult and expensive to build or expand centrally located freight facilities.  The GAO study notes that land near the Port of New York that was previously vacant or used for freight warehouses has recently been redeveloped into high-value commercial and residential property.  As a result, freight distribution centers have moved away from the urban core to the New Jersey suburbs and eastern Pennsylvania where land values are comparatively lower.  However, access to ports is more difficult from these locations.<a href="index.html%3Fid=illustration.html#fn1">[1]</a></p>   

        <p>Congestion that affects freight mobility has direct effects on users of freight transportation such as producers and end users of the products.  Transportation costs and increases in these costs due to congestion are factored into the prices of the goods being transported.  The GAO study reports that one shipper said that deliveries to a congested urban area cost about five times more than those to noncongested areas.  It cites another study that estimates that roadway congestion delays cost shippers approximately $10 billion per year and notes that although the freight sector experiences about 27 percent of congestion costs, truck traffic represents only 5 percent of total vehicle miles.<a href="index.html%3Fid=illustration.html#fn2">[2]</a>   A study by Winston and Shirley analyzed the impact of highway congestion on shippers' inventory costs.  These costs are related to the importance of timeliness of the goods being shipped and the consequences of additional transit times.  Congestion also forces a shipper to hold higher inventories, which increases inventory holding costs.  The authors concluded that $7 billion is the best estimate of inventory costs incurred by shippers for delays of shipments due to highway congestion.<a href="index.html%3Fid=illustration.html#fn3">[3]</a>   There are a number of indirect effects of freight transportation congestion as well.  Such indirect effects include the costs of congestion on passenger traffic and negative environmental effects, such as increased air pollution.</p>  

        <p>The effects of congestion on freight mobility, reliability, and costs have future implications for supply chains and logistics.  For example, the GAO report observes that current supply-chain strategies may not be economically beneficial in the future should freight mobility decline and there are increasing costs in the form of higher transportation costs, higher warehousing and operational costs, or missed opportunities for other investments of production.<a href="index.html%3Fid=illustration.html#fn3">[3]</a></p> 

        <p>The costs associated with encroachment can affect a variety of producers and consumers distributed over wide geographic regions.  The fact that these costs are dispersed and encroachment issues may not be particularly newsworthy can create situations in which planners may not be aware of the full economic impact of encroachment.  Furthermore, because the importance of freight transportation in supply chains often spans broad geographic expanses, the widely-dispersed benefits of preventing or relieving freight corridor encroachment are also difficult to assess from a more localized perspective.  Costs and benefits of encroachment can be viewed from two perspectives:  the costs and benefits associated with the status quo; and the costs and benefits associated with changes to the current situation (e.g., preventing or alleviating encroachment).  It is these two perspectives that provide the framework for properly assessing encroachment issues.  Without the appropriate perspective and tools, there is a high probability of inadequately assessing both the costs of encroachment and the economic benefits derived from freight corridors.</p>

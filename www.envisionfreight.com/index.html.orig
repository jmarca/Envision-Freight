    <div id="content">
        <p>A smoothly functioning freight transportation network is essential to the operation of the U.S. economy.  Efficient freight transportation is a very important part of producing and getting products to consumers.  On average, <i>42 tons</i> of freight worth <i>$39,000</i> was delivered to every man, woman, and child in the United States in 2007.  When considering the distance involved in transporting this freight, an average of <i>11,000 ton-miles</i> was delivered to every person in the country.</p>
        <p>U.S. economic and population growth creates increasing competition for the land resources underlying the freight transportation infrastructure.  Amidst such competition, a key to preserving freight transportation facilities and corridors is to prevent or resolve conflicts between freight operations and other land uses.  Some conflicts are more obvious, such as bridge interference with the vertical clearance of railroad corridors or other shipping lanes.  Other conflicts may not be as apparent, such as noise, vibration or environmental effects caused by freight activities.</p>
        <p>As the table below indicates, from the perspective of the community at large, these conflicts generally lead to nuisance, safety, or health concerns.  From the perspective of freight interests, these conflicts can create barriers to efficient transportation that diminish economic performance.</p>
